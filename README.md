# rust_wc
Rust implementation of a wc-like cli utility

## Current features

The current implementation is merely a test-case while I'm learning rust. It accepts one or more filenames to count and does so. _It does not support input piping_.

## To build:

* Clone the repository
* Make sure you have rust installed
* `cargo build`

## Running

From the root project folder, once built:

`$ target/<build_type>/rs-wc file1 file2 file3 ...`
